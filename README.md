# What is this?

A bot that deletes post-promotion links shared in #teammalaysia discord group when it being abused.

## How it works?

All message on discord will send through the bot. The bot act as a middleware after a user send a message. This bot will check the author's last message datetime, and then from there, calculate wether the user have posted any link in the past x hours. (x means you can set it in `src/config.json`)
